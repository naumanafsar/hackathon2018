# Hackathon 2018
----------------
On 01 Dec 2018 I delevered a 25 minutes talk on Amazon Elastic Computing with Python. Which was a part of the System Administration Session at the first ever Hackathon at FAST-NUCES Peshawar Campus. This repo contains all the codes which was the part of my talk and live demo!
----------------
- In "slides" folder there's an index.html which you can open in your browser.
- "hackathon.ipynb" contains my RISE Presentation slides. (In order to run it you need to install Jupyter Notebook with RISE).
- The rest are simple Python scripts which i try to automate it with basic Linux "at" command. for live demo purposes.
